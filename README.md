# MSc Data Science - Final thesis project 

Welcome to my MSc project.

The readme is intended as a quick introduction. This project outlines a novel deep learning architecture in order to frame malware classification as a image classification problem. A capsule neural network (CapsNet) is implemented and compared to other deep network archictectures such as CNNs, and other traditional methods.

This repository contains the final report and the final submitted python notebooks for the postgraduate thesis in completion of the MSc Data Science programme at Birkbeck, University of London. All references are mentioned in the specific code files and the final report file. This repository is also intended purely as a showcase of academic work and all relevant authors should be referenced. Please contact me directly if there are any questions.

The final report should be read for full context and please note, data has not been uploaded to this repository due to the large size and copyright. However in order to run the scripts, information on how to access this has been added as an Appendix in the report.

The python files are the final submitted files. The full commit history is only visible on the repository for the markers and staff at the university.

Happy reading! :-)
